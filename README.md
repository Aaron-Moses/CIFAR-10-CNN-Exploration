# CIFAR-10 Image Classification - My Data Science Exploration

Hey There! ðŸ‘‹
---
I'm diving headfirst into the world of data science and what better way to start than applying what I've learned in my DS 3000 course to a real-world project? This repository is all about my journey through the CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project. It's been quite a ride!

## About the Project
CIFAR-10, a dataset well-known for its collection of everyday images categorized into 10 types, is the playground for this project. I've been working on building models that can look at these small images and tell us whether it's a dog, a truck, or something else. It's not just about the code; it's about seeing theory come to life.

### What's Inside
1. **Starting Simple**: I kicked things off with a basic CNN model. This was my baseline - setting the stage for what's to come.
2. **Leveling Up**: Next, I put on my lab coat and experimented with some fancier stuff like Batch Normalization and Dropout. The goal? Better, smarter models.

## My Learning Experience
This project is a leap from my Data Science 3000 course into the real world. It's one thing to learn about algorithms and models in class, and entirely another to get them working on actual data. I'm learning, stumbling, and growing.

## What's in this Repo
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks where I've scribbled all my code and thoughts.
- `data/`: It's got the CIFAR-10 dataset (well, links to it â€“ it's pretty big!).
- `models/`: My precious models, saved after much trial and error.
- `images/`: Some cool visuals and predictions from the models.

## Tools of the Trade
- I've been using Python â€“ it's pretty neat!
- TensorFlow and Keras for the heavy lifting in building models.
- Matplotlib for when I need to draw things out.
- And of course, Jupyter Notebooks â€“ where all my mess and magic happens.

## Wanna Run This?
Check out the notebooks in `notebooks/`. I've put instructions in there to get everything up and running. It's not rocket science, I promise!

I couldn't upload the advanced model due to it's size.

## Onwards and Upwards!
This project is just a start. I'm already thinking about tackling more complex models and maybe diving into other datasets. 

Got ideas? Suggestions? I'm all ears! Feel free to reach out, open an issue, or help me improve with a pull request.
